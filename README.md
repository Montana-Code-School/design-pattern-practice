## Practice design patterns with TDD.

TDD is a loop RED->GREEN->REFACTOR->RED...

* RED - Write a failing test (make sure it fails)
* GREEN - Make test pass in the simplest way possible
* REFACTOR - Clean up the code without changing how it works.

## DECORATOR
We will make a User interface and decorate it to use for different circumstances.

* Create user named John
* John speaks a set of languages, including English and Spanish
* users can not change their own name.

* Create user Jane
* Jane is an Employee; she has a start date of June 12, 2017.
* Her boss will be User Lisa.

## BUILDER
We will make a meal containing multiple entrees.

* Create a steak dinner with 2 sides: mashed potatoes and green beans.
* Create a chicken dinner with 3 sides: soup, garlic bread and a salad.

## OBSERVER
We will make a table that communicates the size of a party to those watching.

* Make an empty table.
* Make waiter and owner observers.
* Listen for when a party arrives and tell all observers.
